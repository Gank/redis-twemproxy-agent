# Redis-Twemproxy Agent

This originally started as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/eveiga/5039007) posted on [a twemproxy ticket about doing HA redis](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy/issues/67).

Edgar was nice enough to share what he had so far and now I'm trying to take it a bit further in hopes of making a generalized package.
